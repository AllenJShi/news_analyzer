# news_analyzer
This is an open-source RSS crawler with an LLM interface, and it can use LLM to analyze news feeds
This open-source project Iâ€™m releasing is mainly for news statistics. It can scrape over 1,000 news articles every three to five minutes, then aggregate and categorize them. You can also input your own API for LLM streaming output and leverage large models to summarize the news. It allows you to tweak the SSR source yourself, making it easy for everyone to customize it based on the target audience when using it.
